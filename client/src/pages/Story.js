      <p className="story">On an evening in early 2012, Amanda was on a night shift for Americanidol.com (in Nakatomi Plaza for any Die Hard Fans), when Eric, who also happened to be working a late shift at Fox Sports just down the street, dropped by her office. He was there to visit Amanda's coworker Erin, whom Eric knew from college, but was also introduced to Amanda for the first time. While no sparks flew on that particular evening, it was only because the journey was destined to begin at a later date.</p>
      <p className="story">Two years later Amanda moved into an apartment in Marina del Rey with Erin and was reintroduced to Eric as they hung out at various social gatherings hosted at her new apartment including Eric's Beerlympics passion project where he tapped Amanda to serve as the referee/peacekeeper. As time went by, they got to know each other more and more until over Memorial Day weekend of 2016 it became apparent that they more than just liked one another as friends. </p>
      <p className="story">Our first eight months together went very smoothly until Eric managed to forget Amanda's birthday in 2017 and tried to make it up to her by planning a wine tasting trip up to the Central Coast of California. After a long weekend of kayaking with otters, drinking Dry Rieslings in Edna Valley and staying at the infamous Madonna Inn, we both couldn't help but to fall in the love with both the area and each other.</p>
      <p className="story">Despite the "small" hiccup, our bond only grew stronger as we continued to discover our mutual interests - cheese, traveling, and playing golf - and sharing our personal interests with one another. Eric managed to drag Amanda to hundreds of breweries and made her hate cooking a little less while Amanda turned Eric into a fan of puzzles, Andrea Bocelli, and good wine.</p>
      <p className="story">After spending the next four years traveling everywhere from Fargo to Zurich, adopting an adorable grey kitty named Nelson, and then spending a year cooped up together during a pandemic, we decided there was no other person we would rather spend the rest of our lives with. On a hot July day in Lindenhurst, New York, Eric asked Amanda to be his "forever-person" in the park her Grandpa used to take her to feed the ducks and she happily agreed.</p>
      <p className="story">We are so excited about the next leg of our journey together and we can't wait to celebrate it with all of our favorite people in a region of California that means so much to us.</p>
